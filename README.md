    This project extends the state of the art in systems model analysis with a focus on behavior models in the open standard Systems Modeling Language (SysML), a systems engineering extension of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) for software specification. The software ingests SysML models in the Object Management Group's (OMG's) open standard for for SysML file formats, XMI, and translates them into logical models in Alloy Analyzer, enabling static semantic analysis of the model.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

The project proposed in this document extends the state-of-the-art in systems model analysis with a focus on behavior models in the open standard Systems Modeling Language (SysML), a systems engineering extension of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) for software specification. The effort will automate translation of these models to an existing open logical solver language. The translation was informally specified in earlier work applying the Ontological Behavior Modeling (OBM) method to SysML behavior models, to unify the various behavior modeling techniques in SysML. Ontological approaches define formal rules for classifying individuals according to some modeling concept, behaviors in this case, which OBM applies to SysML behavior models. Semantics expressed only as free text in existing standards documents is brought into reusable libraries expressed in SysML, enabling logical methods of SysML behavior analysis.

The proposed effort will extend beyond the simpler activity examples in earlier work, exploring more complex and intricate behaviors, enabled by an automated translator. This will support development of recommended model libraries that provide logical semantics for SysML behavior models, making them easier to learn and analyze, and contributing to the next generation of logically-grounded SysML standards.

The proposed effort will continue the analysis and development of representing all UML behavior modeling techniques (activities, states, and interactions) in the same underlying behavior assembly model. Current research efforts focus on capturing simple activity examples to use in developing and verifying the appropriate semantics in reusable model libraries. GTRI is currently exploring these semantics and verifying them using the Alloy Analyzer tool (Alloy). Alloy includes an accessible logical language for expressing complex structural constraints in an object-oriented way, based on first-order logic. Alloy includes access to logical solvers to determine if the constraints are consistent by attempting to produce a solution meeting them. For behavior specifications, this determines whether they are executable by attempting to produce a complete trace of an execution that satisfies all the constraints.

This material is based in part on work supported by U.S. National Institute of Standards grant awards 70NANB19H066, 70NANB20H177, and 70NANB22H093 to Georgia Tech Applied Research Corporation, and 70NANB18H200 to Engisis, LLC.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

TBD

[comment]: <> (This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.)

[comment]: <> (To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.)

### Prerequisites

In order to build the project, maven needs to be installed and added to environment variables (instructions here https://maven.apache.org/), and you need access to the private repository for omgutil (https://github.com/ontological-behavior-modeling/omgutil.git). A github token needs to be added to your local maven settings.xml file. A sample settings.xml file is included in the repository with information about creating a github token and adding it to the file.

[comment]: <> (This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.)

[comment]: <> (* npm)

[comment]: <> (  ```sh)

[comment]: <> (  npm install npm@latest -g)

[comment]: <> (  ```)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository onto local machine (https://github.com/ontological-behavior-modeling/NIST-OBM-Translator.git).
2. Open terminal to location of cloned repository.
3. Enter <code>mvn clean package -DskipTests</code>.
4. Jar file is created in the target folder of the repository. The correct file is appened with "-with-dependencies.jar".
5. Double-click jar file to open.
